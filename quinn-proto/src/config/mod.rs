/// ## QUIC Tokens
///
/// The QUIC protocol defines a concept of "[address validation][1]". Essentially, one side of a
/// QUIC connection may appear to be receiving QUIC packets from a particular remote UDP address,
/// but it will only consider that remote address "validated" once it has convincing evidence that
/// the address is not being [spoofed][2].
///
/// Validation is important primarily because of QUIC's "anti-amplification limit." This limit
/// prevents a QUIC server from sending a client more than three times the number of bytes it has
/// received from the client on a given address until that address is validated. This is designed
/// to mitigate the ability of attackers to use QUIC-based servers as reflectors in [amplification
/// attacks][3].
///
/// A path may become validated in several ways. The server is always considered validated by the
/// client. The client usually begins in an unvalidated state upon first connecting or migrating,
/// but then becomes validated through various mechanisms that usually take one network round trip.
/// However, in some cases, a client which has previously attempted to connect to a server may have
/// been given a one-time use cryptographically secured "token" that it can send in a subsequent
/// connection attempt to be validated immediately.
///
/// There are two ways these tokens can originate:
///
/// - If the server responds to an incoming connection with `retry`, a "retry token" is minted and
///   sent to the client, which the client immediately uses to attempt to connect again. Retry
///   tokens operate on short timescales, such as 15 seconds.
/// - If a client's path within an active connection is validated, the server may send the client
///   one or more "validation tokens," which the client may store for use in later connections to
///   the same server. Validation tokens may be valid for much longer lifetimes than retry token.
///
/// The usage of validation tokens is most impactful in situations where 0-RTT data is also being
/// used--in particular, in situations where the server sends the client more than three times more
/// 0.5-RTT data than it has received 0-RTT data. Since the successful completion of a connection
/// handshake implicitly causes the client's address to be validated, transmission of 0.5-RTT data
/// is the main situation where a server might be sending application data to an address that could
/// be validated by token usage earlier than it would become validated without token usage.
///
/// [1]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-8
/// [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing
/// [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Amplification
///
/// These tokens should not be confused with "stateless reset tokens," which are similarly named
/// but entirely unrelated.

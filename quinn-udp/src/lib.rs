//! Uniform interface to send and receive UDP packets with advanced features useful for QUIC
//!
//! This crate exposes kernel UDP stack features available on most modern systems which are required
//! for an efficient and conformant QUIC implementation. As of this writing, these are not available
//! in std or major async runtimes, and their niche character and complexity are a barrier to adding
//! them. Hence, a dedicated crate.
//!
//! Exposed features include:
//!
//! - Segmentation offload for bulk send and receive operations, reducing CPU load.
//! - Reporting the exact destination address of received packets and specifying explicit source
//!   addresses for sent packets, allowing responses to be sent from the address that the peer
//!   expects when there are multiple possibilities. This is common when bound to a wildcard address
//!   in IPv6 due to [RFC 8981] temporary addresses.
//! - [Explicit Congestion Notification], which is required by QUIC to prevent packet loss and reduce
//!   latency on congested links when supported by the network path.
//! - Disabled IP-layer fragmentation, which allows the true physical MTU to be detected and reduces
//!   risk of QUIC packet loss.
//!
//! Some features are unavailable in some environments. This can be due to an outdated operating
//! system or drivers. Some operating systems may not implement desired features at all, or may not
//! yet be supported by the crate. When support is unavailable, functionality will gracefully
//! degrade.
//!

# Connection Setup

In the [previous chapter](certificate.md) we looked at how to configure a certificate.
This aspect is omitted in this chapter to prevent duplication. 
But **remember** that this is required to get your [Endpoint][Endpoint] up and running. 
This chapter explains how to set up a connection and prepare it for data transfer. 

It all starts with the [Endpoint][Endpoint] struct, this is the entry point of the library. 

## Example

Let's start by defining some constants. 

```rust
static SERVER_NAME: &str = "localhost";

fn client_addr() -> SocketAddr {
    "127.0.0.1:5000".parse::<SocketAddr>().unwrap()
}

fn server_addr() -> SocketAddr {
    "127.0.0.1:5001".parse::<SocketAddr>().unwrap()
}
```   

The [EndpointBuilder][EndpointBuilder] should be used to configure an endpoint. It is also possible to provide Quinn with an initialized socket via [with_socket()][with_socket]. 

**Server**

First, the server endpoint should be bound to a socket. 
The [bind()][bind] method, which can be used for this, returns a tuple containing the `Endpoint` and `Incoming` types. 
The `Endpoint` type can be used to start outgoing connections, and the `Incoming` type can be used to listen for incoming connections.

```rust
async fn server() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut endpoint_builder = Endpoint::builder();
    // Configure this endpoint as a server by passing in `ServerConfig`.
    endpoint_builder.listen(ServerConfig::default());

    // Bind this endpoint to a UDP socket on the given server address. 
    let (endpoint, mut incoming) = endpoint_builder.bind(&server_addr())?;

    // Start iterating over incoming connections.
    while let Some(conn) = incoming.next().await {
        let mut connection: NewConnection = conn.await?;

        // Save connection somewhere, start transferring, receiving data, see DataTransfer tutorial.
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Client**

The client needs to connect to the server using the [connect(server_name)][connect] method.  
The `SERVER_NAME` argument is the DNS name, matching the certificate configured in the server.

```rust
async fn client() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut endpoint_builder = Endpoint::builder();

    // Bind this endpoint to a UDP socket on the given client address.
    let (endpoint, _) = endpoint_builder.bind(&client_addr())?;

    // Connect to the server passing in the server name which is supposed to be in the server certificate.
    let connection = endpoint.connect(&server_addr(), SERVER_NAME)?.await?;

    // Start transferring, receiving data, see data transfer page.

    Ok(())
}
```

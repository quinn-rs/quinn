//! QUIC transport protocol support for Tokio
//!
//! [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) is a modern transport protocol addressing
//! shortcomings of TCP, such as head-of-line blocking, poor security, slow handshakes, and
//! inefficient congestion control. This crate provides a portable userspace implementation. It
//! builds on top of quinn-proto, which implements protocol logic independent of any particular
//! runtime.
//!
//! The entry point of this crate is the [`Endpoint`](generic/struct.Endpoint.html).
//!

let mut builder = quinn::Endpoint::builder();

// ... use endpoint ...

//! # About QUIC
//!
//! A QUIC connection is an association between two endpoints. The endpoint which initiates the
//! connection is termed the client, and the endpoint which accepts it is termed the server. A
//! single endpoint may function as both client and server for different connections, for example
//! in a peer-to-peer application. To communicate application data, each endpoint may open streams
//! up to a limit dictated by its peer. Typically, that limit is increased as old streams are
//! finished.
//!
//! Streams may be unidirectional or bidirectional, and are cheap to create and disposable. For
//! example, a traditionally datagram-oriented application could use a new stream for every
//! message it wants to send, no longer needing to worry about MTUs. Bidirectional streams behave
//! much like a traditional TCP connection, and are useful for sending messages that have an
//! immediate response, such as an HTTP request. Stream data is delivered reliably, and there is no
//! ordering enforced between data on different streams.
//!
//! By avoiding head-of-line blocking and providing unified congestion control across all streams
//! of a connection, QUIC is able to provide higher throughput and lower latency than one or
//! multiple TCP connections between the same two hosts, while providing more useful behavior than
//! raw UDP sockets.
//!
//! Quinn also exposes unreliable datagrams, which are a low-level primitive preferred when
//! automatic fragmentation and retransmission of certain data is not desired.
//!
//! QUIC uses encryption and identity verification built directly on TLS 1.3. Just as with a TLS
//! server, it is useful for a QUIC server to be identified by a certificate signed by a trusted
//! authority. If this is infeasible--for example, if servers are short-lived or not associated
//! with a domain name--then as with TLS, self-signed certificates can be used to provide
//! encryption alone.
